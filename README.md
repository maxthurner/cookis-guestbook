## Overview

This project was developed by using Xampp as an local Webserver and Database host.

The architecture is structured as following:
* Basic Frontend: index.html
    - Technologies used: HTML/CSS; Plain JS; Vue.js; Ajax; jQuery
    - WYSIWYG Texteditor: CKEditor Basic
    - Header Gimmick: particles.js

* Data Access Services: selectEntries.php , newEntry.php, delete.php, like.php

* Backend Access:   login.php, admin.php
    
The overall architecture could be improved - but for cost-benefit factor and quick understanding this was sufficient.

## Database

*   For quick development a MySQL database was used, and data was split up to fit a relational form.
    A NoSQL database would be prefered no handle just JSON data - however Xampp doesn't provide it and I didn't have a clean server to play around.
    
    Therefore selected data from the database was brought into JSON format after recieving it.
    
    SQL Injection tested and approved.

*   Database Architecture:
    Table
    - articles    includes    ID[Serial, PK], Username[varchar(64)], Email[varchar(64)], Message[text,!Null], Timestamp[timestamp, current_timestamp()], Likes[int]
    - user        includes    ID[Serial, PK], Username[varchar(255)], Password[varchar(255)]

* Improvements (Security) to do:
     - Split user and rights even more (Readonly user)
     - secure db user credentials --> At the moment you need to change the database informations directly in the file credentials.php
  

> to Secure passwords a way would be to store the password in a .htaccess file in a not publicly accessible folder.
> or on an Apache Webserver in a httpd.conf or virtual hosts file.
> Furthermore this File should be hidden by htaccess so nobody can directly view this file in browser.


## Things to improve / Bugs
* Bot secure
    Add of a simple Captcha (reCAPTCHA) to prevent Bot posts on the page.

* Page View List Objects
    if more than x posts are returned -> multipage view of comments, so it doesn't end in an endless scrolling party
    --> How do you correctly access Vue data objects rendered in list?

* Non User authentication
    find if user (device/used browser) has already liked a post (simple cookie with IDs of liked posts)

* Nr. of Likes Div Stlying --> Doesn't fit too large numbers
